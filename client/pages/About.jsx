            Hello Giallo is an app to help the discerning cinephile navigate the
            giallo, a notoriously impenetrable movie genre, and identify movies
            of interest.
            <br />
            <br />
            The giallo bridges the gap between Hitchcock’s harder-edged films
            like Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963) and the American slasher,
            popularised by the likes of Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th
            (1980). The genre is often reductively yet somewhat accurately
            referred to as “Italian slashers”.
            <br />
            <br />
            Gialli span a spectrum from violent and visceral horrors, to
            romantic crime capers, to psychological surrealism, sometimes all in
            the space of the same movie. It can be hard to know where to start -
            one-hundred gialli were released between 1971 and 1975 alone! Hello
            Giallo allows users to narrow down the options in line with their
            preferences.
